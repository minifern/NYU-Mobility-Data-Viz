# About NYU-Mobility-Data-Viz

This is my contribution to the Orientation and Mobility Data Visualization Project, where a website dashboard is used by O&M specialists to track mobility data (step count, GPS location, balance) of patients.

This work was done under Graham Dove at NYU Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP)

# How to Use
Sample data is ``` mobility.json ```

``` dashboard-trail.html ``` is latest version

``` delete-day-heatmap.html ``` has a more functional heatmap display and only illustrates step data

``` dashboard-trail.css ``` can be used universally
